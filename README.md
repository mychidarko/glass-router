# Glass Router (GlassRX)

Glass router is a wrapper around `react-router-dom` which provides a clean and developer friendly approach to routing in React. GlassRX provides an extensible structure which opens up your project to more scalable setups.

*GlassRX is heavily inspired by `vue-router` and bases many features and conventions off of it.*

**Glass router is still being developed and so supports only the main react router features. Check this page for feature updatesðŸ˜‡.**

## Installation

You can easily add GlassRX to your project with:

```sh
npm i glass-router --save
```

or

```sh
yarn add glass-router
```

## Usage

To get started with glass router, simply import it in one of your base files, usually `App.js` (CRA). From there you can simply register your routes and let glass do the rest for you.

```js
// import glass router
import GlassRouter from "glass-router";

// bring in a route
import Home from "./Home";

// define all your routes
const routes = [
  {
    path: "/",
    exact: true,
    component: Home,
    name: "home",
  },
];

// initialize glass with all your routes
GlassRouter.options({ routes });

// Export routes into JSX
const Routes = () => GlassRouter.render();

// Build your app
const App = () => <Routes />;

export default App;
```

## Why use glass router?

- **Glass is easy to use**

    GlassRX focuses on simplicity and ease of use from a developer standpoint. From the example above, in order to add a new route, all you need to do is add a new route object.

    ```js
    const routes = [
        {
            path: "/",
            exact: true,
            component: Home,
            name: "home",
        },
        {
            path: "/dashboard",
            component: Dashboard,
            name: "dashboard",
        },
    ];
    ```

- **Easy to customize**

    Glass makes available an options method which allows you to make glass behave the way you want it to behave.

    ```js
    GlassRouter.options({
        // Use a hash router instead of history
        mode: "hash",
        // force full page reloads instead of SPA mode
        forceRefresh: true,
        routes
        // a lot more settings are available below
    });
    ```

- **Glass is more "scalable"**

    GlassRX gives you features which allow you to prioritize scalable and "good code" over the norm. One such feature is `named routes`. Named routes allow you to use route names instead of paths for routing...as paths can change at any time. Route names are defined on route initialization:

    ```js
    {
        path: "/dashboard",
        component: Dashboard,
        // name is defined here
        name: "dashboard",
    },
    ```

    To route to a path, you can use:

    ```js
    GlassRouter.push({ name: "dashboard" });
    ```

    You can also use the link component if you're in a component:

    ```js
    import { Link } from "glass-router";

    ...

    <Link to={{ name: "dashboard" }}>Dashboard</Link>
    ```

## Route Meta

Sometimes, you might want to attach arbitrary information to routes like classnames, who can access the route, etc. This can be achieved through the `meta` property which accepts an object of properties and can be accessed on the route location and navigation guards. You can define `meta` properties like this:

```js
GlassRouter.options({
  routes: [
    {
      path: 'bar',
      component: Bar,
      // a meta field
      meta: { requiresAuth: true }
    },
  ],
});
```

So how do we access this `meta` field?

An example use case is checking for a meta field in the global navigation guard:

```js
GlassRouter.beforeEach(({ to, from, next }) => {
  if (to.meta.requiresAuth) {
    // this route requires auth, check if logged in
    // if not, redirect to login page.
    if (!auth.loggedIn()) {
      next({ path: "/login" });

      // or

      next("/login");

      // or

      next({ name: "login" });
    } else {
      next();
    }
  } else {
    next(); // make sure to always call next()!
  }
});
```

### Middleware

Using this concept, glassRX includes a middleware feature out of the box which allows you to write middleware which should be run before routing to the intended page.

To get started, simply define the `meta` property on your route with a property middleware which holds an array of middleware to call on the specified route.

```js
import auth from "./config/middleware/auth";

const routes = [
  {
    path: "/checkout",
    component: () => import('./Checkout'),
    name: "checkout",
    meta: {
      // middleware here
      middleware: [auth],
    },
  },
];
```

Here's an example of middleware that redirects to login if the user isn't logged in:

```js
import { hasAuth } from "../../helpers/user";

export default function auth({ next }) {
  if (hasAuth()) {
    return next();
  }

  return next({ name: "login" });
}
```

Your middleware is passed an object containing the `from`, `to` and `next` variables. `from` holds data about the route you're coming from, `to` is about the page you're routing to and `next` handles your routing. Leaving `next` empty is essentially the same as `next(to)`.

## Hooks

Besides middleware, glassRX also allows you to hook into the runtime of your routes and invoke some functions. We call these hooks. The available hooks on your routes are:

- **onEnter**: This is called when a page is being routed to
- **onLeave**: This is called when a page is being unmounted

```ts
GlassRouter.options({
  routes: [
    {
      path: "/",
      component: Home,
      onEnter: () => { console.log("Enter"); },
      onLeave: () => { console.log("Leave"); },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Plugins

Plugins are a new feature in glass router which allows you to extend the functionality provided by default. With plugins, you can perform custom operations using hooks registered in glass router. Let's create a plugin which logs the path of every route we move to in the next few lines.

```ts
class RouteLogger {
  onHook({ to }: MiddlwareContext) {
    console.log(to.path);
  }
}
```

That's itðŸ˜± All that's left now is to load in this plugin

```ts
GlassRouter.options({ ..., plugins: [RouteLogger] });
```

GlassRouter plugins hook into specific lifecycles in glass router. The methods which get called in plugins are:

- **onInit** - This runs on glass router init.

<!-- - **onReady** - *not yet implemented*
- **onError** - *not yet implemented* -->

- **onHook** - *runs just before router hooks (beforeEach)*
- **afterHook** - *runs just after router hooks (beforeEach)*
- **onMiddleware** - *runs just before in-route middleware*
- **afterMiddleware** - *runs just after in-route middleware*
- **onEnter** - *runs just before a route is loaded unto the dom*
- **onLeave** - *runs just before a route exits the dom*

## Note

You might have noticed that everything above is very similar to vue router, glassRX includes `react-router` specific options like `exact` and `render`.

Route with `exact` prop

```js
import Home from "./Home"

export default [
  {
    path: "/",
    exact: true,
    component: Home,
    name: "home",
  },
];
```

Route with `render` instead of `component`.

```js
{
  path: "*",
  render: () => <h2>Page Not Found</h2>,
},
```
